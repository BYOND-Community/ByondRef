**Args:** 


 new\_icon: an icon file or /icon object to insert
 
 icon\_state: an optional text string, specifying a single icon state to
 change or add to this icon
 
 dir: an optional direction; the inserted icon will only be added for this
 direction
 
 frame: an optional animation frame (starting at 1); the inserted icon will
 only be added for this frame
 
 moving: Non-zero to insert as a movement state, 0 for a regular non-movement
 state
 
 delay: 0 or null to leave unchanged; positive to set delay for a frame and turn
 rewind off; negative to set delay and rewind

 This adds additional states or images to an existing icon, allowing you to
build directional, animated, and multi-state icons on the fly. If the state
you wish to insert already exists in the file, it will be altered; otherwise
it will be added. An animation may be built a piece at a time, for example by
inserting an icon into the NORTH direction for animation frame 3.



### 
 Example:



 // start with a non-animated arrow icon
var/icon/I = new('arrow.dmi')
// make a new state called "blink"
var/icon/J = new('arrow.dmi')
I.Insert(J, "blink", delay=-1) // set rewind flag
// create darker shades of the arrow
var/n = 2
for(var/light=9, light>=5, light--)
 J = new('arrow.dmi')
 J.SetIntensity(light/10)
 I.Insert(J, "blink", frame=n++)
// congratulations, you have a pulsating arrow
icon = I


 The icon resulting from this example has two states: The original arrow,
and a new state called "blink" that pulsates between full and Â½
luminance. To use the blinking state after that, set the atom's icon\_state to
"blink".




 (Note for animations: When building an animated icon\_state from scratch,
you can only add 16 new animation frames at a time; i.e., frame<=total\_frames+16.
Higher values for frame will be ignored. This is a safety precaution.)




 If you insert an icon of a different size, the src icon will be resized to
match the size of new\_icon. (The only exception is if you are using the TILED\_ICON\_MAP
map\_format, and new\_icon is a single tile being inserted as a chunk into a larger icon.
If icon\_state, such as "2,0" or "open 0,0", already exists in src as one of its smaller
pieces, then new\_icon will be inserted in its place.)




 When inserting an individual animation frame, you can change the delay for
just that frame only. If you don't specify a delay, the nearest frame's delay
will be used. If this is the first frame being inserted into an icon, then
the delay will default to 1 tick. Remember, if your delay is positive, it will
turn off the rewind flag for that entire icon state; negative will turn it on.
