 The \_\_MAIN\_\_ macro is defined in the main
 `.dme` 
 file being
compiled. In all other files included by this file, \_\_MAIN\_\_ is not defined.



`.dme`

 The purpose of this is for library writers to package a small demo of their
library directly in the library source code. When users compile the library
directly, the library's own
 `.dme` 
 is the main file and can include
extra files that are not normally part of the library.



`.dme`
### 
 Example:



 #ifdef \_\_MAIN\_\_
#include "demo.dm"
#include "demo.dmm"
#endif


 If the demo requires a lot of extra resources, it is probably better to
package the demo as a separate project. Small demos, however, are nice and
convenient using this "auto-demo" techniqueâ€”especially since Dream
Seeker automatically launches Dream Maker after installing a library
containing a
 `.dme` 
 file.
