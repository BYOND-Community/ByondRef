 null
------



 Variables that are not initialized have the value null. This value is
distinct from 0 and "". If you compare it to these, using the
 `==` 
 operator, it is not equal. However, in a numeric context (like a mathematical
operation), null evaluates to 0 and in a text context (like insertion into a
text expression), null evaluates to "". In a logical expression, null, 0, and
"" evaluate to false and all other values are true.



`==`

 In an embedded text expression, null behaves like "". That means, if you
are expecting a variable to display a 0, you should explicitly initialize it
to 0 rather than leaving it as null.
