 preprocessor
--------------



 The preprocessor performs various transformations on source code as the DM
compiler reads the file. It may be used to define macrosâ€”that is words
which are replaced by other fragments of code. It is also possible to insert
other source code files and to conditionally compile or not compile sections
of code.




 Preprocessor commands are called directives. They are placed on a line by
themselves and always begin with a hash symbol
 `#` 
 . The
preprocessor directives recognized by DM are the same as standard C compilers:
