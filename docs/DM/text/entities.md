 Special characters may be inserted into text using HTML syntax. Such
characters are known as entities. They start with an ampersand and end with a
semicolon. The main reason for doing this is to insert characters that
otherwise have a special meaning. The most common entities have names. The
rest must be referred to by their Unicode character number (e.g. &#38; is
the same as &amp;). The common ones are listed in the following table.
Note that the same effect may be achieved by simply escaping the special
character (like
 `\<` 
 ). The full entity syntax is included for
generality.



`\<`
