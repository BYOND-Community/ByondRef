 List: List to encode as a text string.

**Args:**

 List: List to encode as a text string.


 This instruction converts a list of parameter names and associated values
into a single text string suitable for use in a URL or similar situation.
The format of the resulting text string is:




 "name1=value1&name2=value2&..."


 Special characters such as '=' and '&' inside the parameter names or
values are written in the form:
 `%xx` 
 where
 `xx` 
 are
two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII value of the character. For
 [Unicode](#/{notes}/Unicode) 
 characters, their UTF-8 encoding will
be processed this way, which may make up multiple
 `%xx` 
 sequences.
In addition, spaces are converted to
 
 +
 
 .



`%xx`
`xx`
[Unicode](#/{notes}/Unicode)
`%xx`

 +


 This parameter format is the same one used by most HTML forms and is
known by the MIME type
 
 application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
 . It is
often used in DM to pack information into topic links.




 application/x-www-form-urlencoded


 The original list has items
 
 "name1"
 
 ,
 
 "name2"
 
 , and so on.
These in turn are associated with the corresponding values
 
 "value1"
 
 ,
 
 "value2"
 
 , and so on.




 "name1"


 "name2"


 "value1"


 "value2"

### 
 Example:



 var/plist[0]

plist["offense"] = "jwalk"
plist["time"] = "10:00"

usr << list2params(plist)


 The above example creates a simple parameter list which associates the
item "offense" with the value "jwalk" and the item "time" with the value
"10:00". This will produce the text string "offense=jwalk&time=10:00".




 Object values in the list (like say a mob) get turned into references in
the parameter text, just as though you had embedded them with "\ref[Object]".
When read back in with params2list(), you could convert these values back into
real references by using locate().
