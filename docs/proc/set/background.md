 To avoid lag from procedures that hog the CPU for too long, you can turn on
background processing. This will cause it to periodically sleep for long
enough to allow other events to be processed.




 The following example is a typical "ticker" procedure. It spawns off an
infinite loop which does some work and then sleeps before iterating again. By
running this in the background, you ensure that the work being done does not
create large delays. You could achieve a similar thing by sprinkling calls to
sleep(0) or sleep(-1) in the "working" part of the loop.



### 
 Example



 proc/Ticker()
 set background = 1
 spawn while(1)
 for(var/mob/M in world)
 M.Tick()
 sleep(10)


 Since the background procedure sleeps at unpredictable times, you must be
aware that race conditions are possible if the background procedure interacts
with variables modified by other procedures. It's still much safer than
multi-threaded programs because the background procedure never interrupts
other code; but other code may interrupt the background procedure.




 Note that procedures that are called by the background procedure do not
automatically run in the background unless they too have the background
setting turned on. For instance, the code in the above example does not imply
that the mob Tick() procs would run in the background. This is convenient,
because you should only ever apply background processing to code after
checking that there are no potential race conditions involved.




 If you have an eye for race conditions, you might think that the above code
has one in which a mob gets deleted after it is assigned to M but before the
call to M.Tick() is executed. However,
 *background processing is only
interrupted at loop points in the code* 
 , so the above code is safe. It
would only ever be interrupted at the end of the
 `for` 
 or
 `while` 
 loops.
