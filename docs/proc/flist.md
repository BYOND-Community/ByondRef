**Returns:**

 A list of files contained in the specified directory and whose names
 begin with the specified text. The names of sub-directories are listed
 too, and are marked by a trailing "/".


 The path is of the form "dir1/dir2/.../file". Only files beginning with
the "file" part are listed, so be sure to end a directory name with "/" if
you wish to see its contents. Otherwise you will just get that directory
name back with a "/" appended.




 Only files and sub-directories directly contained in the specified path
are listed (ie not the contents of the sub-directories too). The file names
in the list do not include the path information but just the bare file name.
