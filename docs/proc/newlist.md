### 
 Example:



 mob/contents = newlist(/obj/scroll/readme)


 This causes new mobs to be created with a readme scroll in their
inventory.




 It is possible to make simple initializations when you want variables to
have values other than the default for the particular type you are creating.



### 
 Example:



 mob/contents = newlist(
 /obj/scroll/readme {
 name = "Introduction"
 desc = "The fate of Bracolia depends on you ..."
 }
)


 This is the most common use of "modified types", but it is not specific to
the newlist instruction. Anywhere a type value may be used in DM, it may be
followed by a list of initializations. The general syntax for a modified
types is:




*path* 
 {
 *var1* 
 =
 *val1* 
 ;
 *var2* 
 =
 *val2* 
 }



*path*
*var1*
*val1*
*var2*
*val2*

 The semicolon is necessary if you put several variable assignments on the
same line. The braces are necessary, even though they are generally optional
in DM (since the compiler looks at your indentation). The reason is that the
path + initializations must be parsed as a single expression, which is a
different context from the usual use of braces in DM when you are defining a
true type. Also, indentation inside of an argument list is always ignored
anyway.
