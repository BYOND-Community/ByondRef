 When a proc sleeps, it actually makes a copy of itself. The copy is what
will wake up later, and the current proc simply ends. The same thing happens
to its callers.
 




 When a proc sleeps, it actually makes a copy of itself. The copy is what
will wake up later, and the current proc simply ends. The same thing happens
to its callers.




 Pause the current proc (and its callers) for a specified amount of time.
If no delay is specified, it will be scheduled to resume as soon as other
immediately pending events are processed.




 Note that sleeping in some procedures results in the return value being
lost. For example, if you sleep inside
 `Entered()` 
 or
 `Exited()` 
 , it will be as if you returned immediately where you
started sleeping. This is because
 
 Move()
 
 calls them in away that says
the return value should be ignored. Also if a proc has its
 [waitfor](#/proc/set/waitfor) 
 setting changed to 0, it
will return the value of the
 
 .
 
 var to its caller immediately if it or
one of its callees sleeps.

 Also be aware that a sleeping procedure whose
 
 src
 
 object gets
deleted will automatically terminate when execution returns to it. This is
to protect you against trying to access properties or procedures of a
deleted (and therefore
 `null` 
 ) object. If you do not want the
procedure to be terminated, you should set
 
 src
 
 to
 `null` 
 .




 src

`null`

 src

`null`

 One common use of
 `sleep` 
 is to create what is known as a
 *ticker* 
 . That is an infinite loop that performs some periodic
operation.



`sleep`
*ticker*
### 
 Example:



 proc/Weather()
 spawn while(1) //infinite ticker loop
 world << "The sun rises in the east."
 sleep(500)
 world << "The noon day sun rises high in the sky."
 sleep(500)
 world << "The sun sinks low in the west."
 sleep(1000)


 Notice how such infinite loops are usually created using
 `spawn` 
 to prevent the caller from getting locked up. You could
call this procedure from
 `world.New()` 
 to start it rolling.



`spawn`
`world.New()`

 Note: sleep time is in 1/10s units, not server ticks. If your
 `world.tick_lag` 
 or
 `world.fps` 
 value is different from
the default,
 
 sleep(1)
 
 still means "sleep for 1/10s". To sleep for
exactly
 
 N
 
 ticks, call
 `sleep(N * world.tick_lag)` 
 .



`world.tick_lag`
`world.fps`

 sleep(1)


 N

`sleep(N * world.tick_lag)`

 If the ticker does intensive processing during each iteration, you probably
want to run it in the background like this:




 proc/Ticker()
 set background = 1


 Calling sleep() with a negative argument (such as sleep(-1)) causes it to
do a backlog check. Only if other pending events have become backlogged will
it sleep. This is similar to running in the background, but you manually
control where the backlog checks are made. The difference between this and
sleep(0) is that sleep(0)
 *always* 
 sleeps the current procedure for as
short a time as possible, whereas sleep(-1) only sleeps the current procedure
if other scheduled events have become backlogged. Therefore, sleep(-1) will
tend to run the current procedure at a higher priority with fewer
interruptions. It is appropriate when there is a single task that needs to be
done before anything else can happen, and you just want to make sure that
network and user I/O are not terribly lagged in the process.



*always*
