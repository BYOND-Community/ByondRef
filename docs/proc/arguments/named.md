 The parameters passed to a procedure are called arguments. These may
either be passed in positional order, or they can be passed as
 *named
arguments* 
 . Not all procedures are defined with the intention of
supporting named arguments, so consult the documentation for the procedure in
question first. (This is mainly an issue of whether the argument names might
change in the future.)



*named
arguments*

 The following example shows several ways of producing the same call to a
procedure.



### 
 Example:



 mob/proc/MyProc(a,b,c)
 src << "MyProc([a],[b],[c])"

mob/verb/test()
 MyProc(1,2,3) //positional parameters
 MyProc(a=1,b=2,c=3) //named arguments
 MyProc(1,b=2,c=3) //positional and named arguments
 MyProc(c=3,a=1,b=2) //named arguments can come in any order


 To prevent silent errors, named arguments that do not match any of the
arguments of the procedure being called will generate a runtime error. This
is somewhat different from the behavior of positional arguments in DM where it
is perfectly acceptable to pass more arguments than were explicitly defined in
the procedure.




 As always, arguments that are not assigned in the call will simply be given
the value null (or whatever default value is specified in the definition).




 When an object procedure is overridden, the variable names in the new
definition are the ones that get matched against named arguments in a call to
that procedure. A procedure which is intended to support named arguments
should therefore be defined with care so as to conform to the interface
expected by users of the procedure. That doesn't stop you from changing that
interface when overriding a procedure, but the normal case would be to
preserve the argument names of the base procedure when overriding it.




 The following example is not useful, but it illustrates a situation where a
procedure is overridden so as to preserve the same argument names and
positions. As mentioned above, you are not
 *required* 
 to preserve
either the names or positions, but that is usually what you want.



*required*
### 
 Example:



 mob
 proc/MyProc(a,b,c)
 usr << "mob.MyProc([a],[b],[c])"

 mob/verb/test()
 MyProc(a=1,b=2,c=3)

 special\_mob
 MyProc(a,b,c,d)
 if(d) ..() //pass in same order
 else ..(c,b,a) //pass in reverse order

 test()
 MyProc(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=0) //normal order
 MyProc(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=1) //reverse the order


 This example merely used positional parameters in the call to
 `..()` 
 , but one can use named arguments there too if it is
desirable.



`..()`

 The best time to use named arguments is when calling a procedure that takes
a lot of optional parameters. You can just name the ones that you want to
assign and leave the rest unspecified. Trying to do the same thing with
positional parameters can be much more awkwardâ€“especially when the
arguments you do want to assign are preceded by a number of ones that you
don't care to assign. It's easy to lose your place in the list or to forget
what it does.




 Since named arguments involve a slight amount of extra overhead, one should
avoid them in code that is highly cpu intensive due to being called many many
times. Otherwise, code clarity may be a bigger priority.
