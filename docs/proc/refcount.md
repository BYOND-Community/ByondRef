 A count of references for the object.

**Returns:**

 A count of references for the object.


 This gets a reference count for a value, not including the reference that
was placed on the stack while evaluating this proc.




 A return value of 0 can mean one of several things: Either this was the last
reference and the object was subsequently deleted after refcount(), or the
value doesn't support reference counting.




 Note: A nonzero return value does not necessarily mean the object will be
deleted when its count reaches zero; mobs for instance will not be
soft-deleted by the garbage collector if their
 
 key
 
 var is set, and
some objects like clients and areas never soft-delete. A zero value also does
not necessarily mean the object is immortal; it may be transient, like the
 
 args
 
 list in a proc that only lives as long as that copy of the proc
lives.
