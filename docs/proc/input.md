 Creates a prompt dialog that asks the user for a response. The current proc
sleeps until they respond.




 The only required argument is the message. The type may be any combination of
input types allowed for verb arguments, which can be combined with the
 
 |
 
 operator. The
 
 null
 
 type will allow the user to cancel, e.g.
 
 as null | anything in contents
 
 .




 |


 null


 as null | anything in contents

### 
 Example:



 mob/verb/create\_character()
 usr.name = input("Choose a name for your character.",
 "Your Name",
 usr.name)

 usr.gender = input("Select a gender for your character.",
 "Your Gender",
 usr.gender) in list("male","female","neuter")


 If the target of the input prompt is not a player, the result will be the
default value. If no default value is specified and null is allowed by the
input type, null will be returned. Otherwise, an error will result, crashing
the proc that called
 
 input()
 
 .




 input()


 A more common use for
 
 input()
 
 is to give a player a list of
things to choose from. For example, this is a simple shopkeeper NPC, where
the shopkeeper's inventory is its contents.




 input()

### 
 Example:



 mob/shopkeeper/verb/Buy()
 var/list/options = list()
 var/obj/item
 for(item in src)
 // show a pretty list of options with prices included
 options["[item]: $[item.price]"] = item
 var/choice = input("Buy something!", "Shop") as null|anything in options
 item = options[choice]
 if(!item) return // user canceled
 if(item.price > usr.gold)
 usr << "You can't afford that."
 else
 // give the buyer a copy of the item
 var/t = item.type
 new t(usr)
 usr.gold -= item.price
 usr << "You bought \a [item] for $[item.price]."


 Using
 
 as num
 
 is another popular input choice, which you might use
for haggling, deciding how many of an item to pick up or drop, etc.




 as num


 This next part is important! Always validate input from a
user to make sure it's correct.




 You should be sure to sanitize any user input to make sure the value is
valid. For instance, if you have a verb that gives gold to another player, you
should check that the amount isn't negative and doesn't contain any fractions,
and isn't more than they have.



### 
 Example:



 mob/player/verb/Give\_Gold()
 set src in oview(1)
 var/amount = input("How much?", "Give gold") as null|num
 if(isnull(amount)) return
 amount = floor(amount) // round down to a whole number
 amount = min(amount, usr.gold) // don't give more than you have
 if(amount <= 0) return // ignore negatives and 0
 gold += amount
 usr.gold -= amount
 usr << "You gave [src] $[amount]."
 src << "[src] gave you $[amount]."


 Likewise if you're allowing a user to input text, it too should be
sanitized. If they shouldn't enter multi-line text, you should strip out
 
 "\n"
 
 characters. If they're putting in something like a character
name, strip out any HTML via
 
 html\_encode()
 
 , or you can simply
reject anything that contains invalid characters and make them do it again.




 "\n"


 html\_encode()
