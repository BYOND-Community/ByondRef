 continue Label


 Begins the next iteration of the loop with the given label. If no label
is specified, the innermost loop containing the continue statement is
assumed.




 In a
 
 for(Init,Test,Inc)
 
 loop, the
 
 continue
 
 statement will
jump to the
 
 Inc
 
 portion (if any) and move on to the conditional
 
 Test
 
 . In a
 
 for(item in list)
 
 loop, it will skip to the
next item in the list. In a
 
 while
 
 or
 
 do-while
 
 loop,
 
 continue
 
 jumps to the condition in the
 
 while
 
 statement.

### 
 Example:



 client/verb/who()
 var/mob/M
 usr << "Players:"
 for(M in world)
 if(M == usr) continue
 if(M.key) usr << M.key


 This displays a list of players who have a mob in the world. The
 `continue` 
 statement is used here to avoid including the user in
the list. The same thing could have been achieved by using only the
 `if` 
 statement. In more complicated situations, however, very
long conditional expressions and deeply nested
 `if` 
 statements
can be avoided by using
 `continue` 
 and its companion
 `break` 
 .



`continue`
`if`
`if`
`continue`
`break`

 Here is an example using a label to continue an outer loop from inside an
inner one:




 client/verb/loners()
 var/mob/M
 var/mob/G

 usr << "Loners:"
 finding\_loners:
 for(M in world)
 for(G in world)
 if(M in G.group) continue finding\_loners

 //found a loner
 usr << M.name


 This displays a list of mobs who do not belong in anyone else's group.
Notice the syntax for labeling a list. The name of the block is simply
placed in the code followed by a colon and its contents are indented inside
it.
