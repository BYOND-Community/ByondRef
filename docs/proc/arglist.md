 List: a list to be used as the arguments to a procedure


 Normally, if you were to pass a list directly to a procedure, it would only
come through as a singe argument to that procedure. In some cases, you might
instead want the items in the list to become the arguments to the procedure.
That is what
 `arglist()` 
 achieves.



`arglist()`

 If the items in the list are associations, these are treated as
 [named arguments](#/proc/arguments/named) 
 . Each such list item is
matched against the names of the procedure arguments and its associated value
is assigned to that parameter.



[named arguments](#/proc/arguments/named)

 Most built-in DM instructions do not support use of
 `arglist()` 
 , but all user-defined procedures automatically
support it. The built-in instructions which support named arguments will also
support
 `arglist()` 
 .



`arglist()`
`arglist()`

 The following example shows how to use
 `arglist()` 
 with both
positional parameters and named arguments. Both of these examples could be
replaced by a much simpler direct call without need for a list to hold the
arguments; this is just to illustrate the syntax.



`arglist()`
### 
 Example:



 proc/MyProc(a,b)
 usr << "MyProc([a],[b])"

mob/verb/test()
 var/lst = list(1,2)
 MyProc(arglist(lst)) //MyProc(1,2)

 lst = list(b=2,a=1) //just to illustrate that order does not matter
 MyProc(arglist(lst)) //MyProc(b=2,a=1) --> MyProc(1,2)
