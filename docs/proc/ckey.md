**Args:** 


 Key: The player key to convert to canonical form.

**Args:**

 Key: The player key to convert to canonical form.



**Returns:** 


 The key in canonical form. To do this, it strips all punctuation and
 space from the key and converts to lowercase. The result is still
 unique for each different key.

 The result could be used as a unique directory name in a server-side save
file. Each player could be stored in a separate directory. By converting
to canonical form, possible problems resulting from punctuation (like the
path delimiter '/') in the key would be avoided. If players are saved in
stand-alone files, it could be equally useful for generating a unique file
name.




 Note that this may be used on any text string. It is not just limited to
keys.



### 
 Example:



 var/savefile/SaveFile = new("world.sav")
proc/SavePlayer(mob/M)
 var/keydir = ckey(M.key)
 SaveFile.cd = "/players"
 SaveFile.cd = keydir
 M.Write(SaveFile)

proc/LoadPlayer(mob/M)
 var/keydir = ckey(M.key)
 SaveFile.cd = "/players"
 if(!SaveFile.Find(keydir)) return 0
 SaveFile.cd = keydir
 M.Read(SaveFile)
 return 1


 This example defines two procs for saving and loading players to a
server-side file. These could be called in mob.Login() and mob.Logout().
Notice that instead of calling SaveFile.Write(M), this example instead calls
M.Write(SaveFile) directly. The difference is that in this example we did
not want a new mob to be created when loading the player but instead wanted
to load information into an existing mob.




 In this example, the ckey() proc was used, but it would be more efficient
to use mob.ckey, which is the same value precomputed.
