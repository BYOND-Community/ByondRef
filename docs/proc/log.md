 The logarithm is the power to which you have to raise X in order to get
Y. In other words, the following is true (ignoring round-off error):




 X \*\* log(X,Y) == Y


 One nice property of this function is that it gradually increases, with a
slope that continuously tapers off. In other words, it can be useful to
represent diminishing returns from some input, such as money, experience
points, and so forth.
