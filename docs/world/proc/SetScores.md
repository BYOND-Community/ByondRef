 Updates scores that are kept on the BYOND hub.




 The key is an arbitrary text value. Usually a player's key is a good
choice, but you can also use the name of their character, or anything else
you like, as long as it is unique. The key is case-insensitive.




 Scores and stats use data fields, which might be things like "Score",
"Level", "Class", etc. Use list2params() to set the fields that you want to
change. Fields that you do not include in the list will not be changed. A
field with a blank value will be deleted.




 Sending an empty text string for the fields will erase the scores for that
key.




 This proc will return null if there was no way to reach the hub. Use
isnull() to check for a null value. Contacting the hub may take a few
moments, so it is a good idea to use spawn() to avoid holding up the rest of
the game.



### 
 Example:



 var/params

// Change the Score and Pet fields
params = list("Score"=123, "Pet"="Dog")
world.SetScores("Tom", list2params(params))

// Delete the Pet field
params = list("Pet"="")
world.SetScores("Tom", list2params(params))

// Delete Tom's scores entirely
world.SetScores("Tom", "")


 Note: You can specify a different hub path and hub\_password
by adding these as extra arguments, but this is not recommended for security
reasons. If you use this feature, it should only be on games that cannot be
downloaded by the public.
