 This command is for retrieving configuration information that is shared
by applications installed on the same system. The configuration data is
accessed by specifying the configuration "set" and the parameter within that
set. The "sets" defined so far are:




 env system environment variables (changes are not persistent)
admin list of site administrators
ban list of banned users or IP addresses
keyban list of banned users (deprecated)
ipban list of banned addresses (deprecated)


 If no parameter is specified, a list of the names of all available
parameters is returned.




 The format of the configuration data itself is currently being defined.
It will generally be a sequence of parameters (such as produced by
list2params()). For example, each ban entry would have the user's ckey or
ckeyEx as the parameter, and might have data such as
"reason=jerkish;message=You+jerk!".



### 
 Example:



 mob/verb
 ban(key as text)
 world.SetConfig("ban",ckey(key),"reason=fiendish;admin=[ckey]")
 lookban(key as null|text)
 if(key)
 usr << "[key]: [world.GetConfig("ban",key)]"
 else
 var/lst[] = world.GetConfig("ban")
 for(key in lst)
 usr << "[key]: [world.GetConfig("ban",key)]"


 Ban files store information on a game-specific basis. You will only be
able to read and write values that are set for the game you are running 
(defined by the value of world.hub). It is possible for a host to specify
universal bans as well, but these will not be accessible via GetConfig or
SetConfig. If you are using "ban" as the config\_set, IP addresses are
recognized automatically. (See the ban format info below.)




 It is possible, but rarely useful, to specify a configuration "space" of
SYSTEM, USER, HOME, or APP. Settings made in the SYSTEM space are shared by
all BYOND software on the computer. The USER space is shared by all software
owned by the same user. The HOME space is shared by all worlds running with
the same safe home directory. The APP space is shared by all software running
from the same filesystem directory. By default, the USER space is used, and
if that cannot be modified (in safe mode), then HOME is used instead. These
distinctions are sometimes important on a UNIX machine, where there are many
BYOND sites belonging to different users, but even then, the default behavior
is almost always what you want.




 The configuration space is specified inside the configuration set
parameter like this:




 world.SetConfig("APP/keyban",...)


 When reading configuration settings, the spaces are always lumped
together. In cases of settings with the same name but different values, APP
overrides HOME, which overrides USER, which overrides SYSTEM.



### 
 Ban Format



 If you want to create or read bans at runtime by using the "ban" config
set, these are the main parameters currently used:





 type
 

 The ban's type, if any. It can be "sticky", "session", or "time", or a
combination separated by commas. Session bans expire when the current
session is over (world.Reboot() does not affect this).
 

 reason
 

 The reason the ban was implemented; this is for the host's or admin's
purposes only and is not displayed to the user.
 

 message
 

 A message to display to the user.
 

 keys
 

 Other keys caught in a sticky ban.
 

 IP
 

 Other IP addresses caught in a sticky ban.
 

 computer\_id
 

 Other computer\_id values caught in a sticky ban.
 

 time
 

 The number of seconds remaining in the ban. The type parameter must include
"time" for this to mean anything. If this parameter is not present when a timed
ban is read, it means the ban has expired.

 The old "keyban" and "ipban" config files are now just aliases for "ban".
