**When:** 


 Call this to send a message to another server. The message may be
 composed of an optional topic text string (in the address) and an
 optional file. This will call world.Topic() on the remote server,
 which may in turn call world.Import() to access the file.

**Args:** 


 Addr: The address of the recipient server. It should be in the form
 byond://server?topic. The topic portion is optional.
 
 File: The (optional) file to send. This could be a cache file (in
 single quotes) an external file (in double quotes) or a savefile.
 
 Persist: Set to 1 to indicate that the server should keep this connection
open, to expedite subsequent calls to the same address. An open connection can
be closed at a later time by passing 0 in the Persist field.
 
 Clients: An optional client, or list of clients, to tell the receiver
about.

**Default action:** 


 Send the topic text string and file to the remote server and return the
 result of calling world.Topic() there. Note that this will cause the
 caller to sleep while waiting for the necessary data to be transfered.

**Default action:**

### 
 Example:



 mob/verb/shout(Msg as text)
 world << Msg
 world.Export("[ShadowWorld]?shout:[Msg]")


 This example defines a verb that will broadcast a message to everyone in
this world as well as sending it in the form of topic text to another world
whose address is stored in the variable ShadowWorld. This address could be
manually set or could be the result of calling startup().




 It is also possible to access an HTTP server via world.Export(). Simply
use an http address such as:
 
 http://www.byond.com
 
 . This returns a
list of HTTP header parameters as well as the extra values "STATUS" and
"CONTENT". The value associated with the "STATUS" entry is the HTTP status
code returned by the web server (as text). The value associated with the
"CONTENT" entry is the requested resource.




 http://www.byond.com

### 
 Example:



 mob/verb/test()
 var/http[] = world.Export("http://www.byond.com")

 if(!http)
 usr << "Failed to connect."
 return

 usr << "HTTP Header:"
 for(var/V in http)
 usr << "[V] = [http[V]]"

 usr << "\n"

 var/F = http["CONTENT"]
 if(F)
 usr << html\_encode(file2text(F))


 Note that the HTTP request is submitted using the GET method as opposed to
the POST method. Support for POST may be added in the future.




 If the Clients argument is used, it accepts a client that is currently
loggedin, a mob belonging to such a client, or a list of any of these. The
remote server will receive a list of their keys in world.Topic().
