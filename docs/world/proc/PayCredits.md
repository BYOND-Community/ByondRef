 Removes credits from a player's account, if they have enough. The proc
will return 1 if it is successful, or 0 if the attempt failed (usually
because the player doesn't have enough credits). This feature is intended
for games that make use of the credit system, and for security all such
games must use a hub password.




 This proc will return null if there was no way to reach the hub. Use
isnull() to check for a null value. Contacting the hub may take a few
moments, so it is often a good idea to use spawn() to avoid holding up the
rest of the game.



### 
 Example:



 mob/proc/ItemShop()
 var/items = list("Get credits!", "Magic sword"=10, "Skeleton key"=50)
 var/choices[0]
 var/item,price
 for(item in items)
 price = items[item]
 choices["[item]: [price] credit\s"] = item

 var/credits = world.GetCredits(key)
 if(isnull(credits))
 src << "Sorry, the item shop isn't available right now."
 return

 var/choice = input(src,\
 "You have [credits] credit\s. What would you like to purchase?",\
 "Item Shop")\
 as null|anything in choices
 if(!choice) return // cancel

 if(choice == "Get credits")
 src << link("http://www.byond.com/games/Author/MyGame/credits")
 return

 item = choices[choice]
 price = items[item]
 if(!price) return

 src << "Contacting item shop..."
 var/result = world.PayCredits(name, price, "Item shop: [item]")

 if(isnull(result))
 src << "Sorry, the item shop isn't available right now."
 else if(!result)
 src << "You need [price-credits] more credit\s to buy [item]."
 else
 src << "You bought \a [item]!"

 // Now give the user the item and save their character
 // These procs are for you to define
 src.AddEquipment(item)
 src.SaveCharacter()


 Note: You can specify a different hub path and hub\_password
by adding these as extra arguments, but this is not recommended for security
reasons. If you use this feature, it should only be on games that cannot be
downloaded by the public.
