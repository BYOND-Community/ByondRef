**Default action:**



 Reload the world from scratch. Any connected players will automatically
relogin. This would be useful if you needed to recompile the world after
changing some code.




 In a UNIX environment, you can cause a running server to reboot by
sending it the signal SIGUSR1.




 If you override this proc, you must call ..() if you want the reboot to
complete normally.




 For reboots initiated by Dream Seeker, usr will be the mob belonging to
the player who sent the command.
