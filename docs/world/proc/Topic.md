**Default action:** 


 The topic "ping" returns a true value (number of players plus one),
 which may be useful for telling if a server is alive. The topics
 "Reboot" and "Del" will call world.Reboot() and world.Del()
 respectively if the message was sent by the master server.

### 
 Example:



 world/Topic(T)
 if(findtext(T,"shout:") == 1)
 world << copytext(T,7)


 This example allows other servers to send this server topic text of the
form "shout:msg" and will broadcast the message to all the players in this
world.




 The Keys argument is either null, or a list of user keys. Any keys in the
list are logged in to the remote server.
