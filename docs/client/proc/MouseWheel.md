 MouseWheel(object,delta\_x,delta\_y,location,control,params)



**Args:** 


 object: the object under the mouse pointer
 
 delta\_x,delta\_y: amount of wheel movement
 
 location: the turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc. containing the object
 
 control: the name of the skin control involved
 
 params: other parameters including mouse/keyboard flags, icon offsets, etc.; see

**Default action:** 


 Call object.MouseWheel(delta\_x,delta\_y,location,control,params).
 


**Default action:** 

**Default action:**

 Call object.MouseWheel(delta\_x,delta\_y,location,control,params).


 This is called when the mouse wheel is moved while over an object or
control. It is NOT called if over a browser control, or any control that is
currently scrollable.




 Positive values of delta\_x and delta\_y refer to scrolling right or up,
respectively. Negative values are left and down, respectively.




 Don't define this unless you need it, because it generates extra
communication that is otherwise avoided. If you only need wheel support on
specific objects, use atom.MouseWheel() instead which is more selective.
