 The user is prompted to authorize sending of the pager message. The
recipient may easily respond or jump to the sender's location by clicking on
the link in the pager message. The effect is identical to that of the
sending a page through the Dream Seeker pager.




 The options are encoded in the same format read by text2params(). The
valid options are:





 summon (0/1)
 

 If not included in the options, this is 0. If included in the options
without assigning it to anything, it is 1. A value of 1 sends the recipient
the sender's location so they can join by clicking on the message.
 

 email (0/1)
 

 If not included in the options, this is 0. If included in the options
without assigning it to anything, it is 1. A value of 1 sends causes the
message to be delivered as email. If this is not possible, it is delivered as
a long-lived pager message. Normally, pager messages expire within a short
time after being sent (half an hour).
