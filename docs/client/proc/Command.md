 If this proc is used, players will be able to connect to your world via
telnet. All telnet users' commands are routed through this proc instead of
being parsed into verbs. Players who join the world through Dream Seeker
will have their commands parsed as verbs first, and those commands will end
up here only if there is no applicable verb.




 Note that text received by this proc is not interpreted beforehand, so
quotes " and backslashes \ should come through unaltered.




 This proc is primarily useful if you want to handle parsing yourself (like
for a MUD), or if your world is a chat server and verbs are not used much.
