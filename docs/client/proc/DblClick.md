 Call object.DblClick(location,control,params).

**Default action:**

 Call object.DblClick(location,control,params).

### 
 Example:



 client
 DblClick(O)
 usr << "You double-clicked [O]"
 ..() // do default action


 Note that due to network lag, it is possible when clicking on moving
objects for the location of those objects to have changed by the time the
DblClick() proc is executed. That is the reason for the location argument.
It tells you where the click originally took place.
