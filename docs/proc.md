 Procs may be derived from /proc. These procs are "global", in that they
can be called anywhere in the code.



### 
 Example:



 proc/poof()
 world << "POOF!"


 The proc
 
 poof()
 
 may now be called anywhere in the code.




 poof()


 Procs may also be attached to objects by defining them under the
appropriate
 
 object/proc
 
 subnode. Currently DM allows procs to be
defined or overridden for
 
 /mob
 
 ,
 
 /obj
 
 ,
 
 /turf
 
 ,
 
 /area
 
 ,
 
 world
 
 , and
 
 /client
 
 , as well as for
 [datum objects](#/datum) 
 derived from
 
 /
 
 . Predefined procs
are discussed under the "procs" entry for the object type.




 object/proc


 /mob


 /obj


 /turf


 /area


 world


 /client

[datum objects](#/datum)

 /

### 
 Example:



 mob/proc/poof()
 world << "POOF!"


 This can be called by a mob var M, using
 
 M.poof()
 
 .




 M.poof()

### 
 Return types



 It is possible to define what type of value a proc is expected to return,
by following its definition with an
 
 as
 
 clause. This can be a type
path, such as
 
 as /mob/player
 
 , or a more intrinsic type like
 
 as
num
 
 or
 
 as list
 
 .




 as


 as /mob/player


 as
num


 as list

### 
 Example:



 mob/monster
 var/mob/player/target

 proc/GetTarget() as /mob/player
 if(!target)
 // find a /mob/player in view
 target = locate() in view(src)
 return target


 Currently the only purpose for using the
 
 as
 
 clause is for
situations where the compiler needs to infer the type of an expression.
Mainly this applies to the
 [.](#/operator/%2e) 
 and
 [?.](#/operator/%3f%2e) 
 operators in an expression
such as
 
 GetTarget()?.Attack(src)
 
 . Giving
 
 GetTarget()
 
 a return type allows the compiler to check if
 
 Attack()
 
 is a
valid proc for
 
 /mob/player
 
 . Otherwise, the
 
 .
 
 and
 
 ?.
 
 operators act like
 
 :
 
 and
 
 ?:
 
 ,
respectively; the compiler won't do any checking to see if
 
 Attack()
 
 is valid.




 as

[.](#/operator/%2e)
[?.](#/operator/%3f%2e)

 GetTarget()?.Attack(src)


 GetTarget()


 Attack()


 /mob/player

 ?:
