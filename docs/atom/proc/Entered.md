**Format:**

**When:** 


 Called when an object has entered the contents list through Move().
Directly setting the object's loc or step\_x/y vars does not result in a
call to Entered() or any other movement side-effects. The same goes for
creation or deletion of an object at a location.

**Default action:** 


 None for most atoms, but turfs will call Crossed().

 Example:



 turf/pit
 Entered(O)
 O << "OUCH. You fell in a pit!"


 The mob's Entered() and Exited() procs can be used to control what
happens when objects are added or removed from the mob's inventory. Of
course that could all be done within get() and drop() verbs, but the
following code separates user interface from lower-level functions.



### 
 Example:



 obj
 var
 weight = 10
 verb
 get()
 set src in oview(1)
 if(Move(usr))
 usr << "You pick up \a [src]."
 else
 usr << "You cannot pick up [src]."
 drop()
 set src in usr
 if(Move(usr.loc))
 usr << "You drop \a [src]."
mob
 var
 weight
 max\_weight = 50

 Entered(obj/O)
 weight += O.weight
 Exited(obj/O)
 weight -= O.weight
 Enter(obj/O)
 //only allow entrance if weight is within the limit
 if(O.weight + weight <= max\_weight)
 return ..()


 To see the advantages of this arrangement, imagine that there are certain
situations in which an object may be created directly within the mob's
inventory without the mob picking it up. You can still run it through your
normal movement rules without calling get().



### 
 Example:



 mob/verb/wish()
 var/obj/O = new() //create it with loc=null
 if(O.Move(usr)) //and then move it into inventory
 usr << "Your wish has been granted!"
 else
 usr << "You are too greedy!"
 del O
