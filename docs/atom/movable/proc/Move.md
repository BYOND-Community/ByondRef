**Returns:** 


 Success (jump): 1
 
 Success (slide): Number of pixels moved

**Returns:**

 Success (jump): 1
 
 Success (slide): Number of pixels moved

 Failure: 0



**When:** 


 Called to move the object. By default, client.Move() calls this proc when
players use direction keys. The automated movement functions (like walk())
also call this proc. Directly setting the loc variable does
 **not** 
 call this procedure.

 Any Move() is either a slide or a jump. Normal walking around is a slide;
it can be stopped partway. A jump is pass/fail. See more information below.




 This is what happens by default:



1. oldloc.Exit(src) is called for any turfs or areas being vacated, or
the container if moving out of an obj or mob. neighbor.Uncross(src) is called
for any atoms that will no longer be overlapping this object. If any of these
return 0 (failure), movement fails.
2. newloc.Enter(src) is called for any turfs or areas that may be entered
for the first time, or the container if moving into an obj or mob.
neighbor.Cross(src) is called for any atoms that may be in collision with this
object if the move fully succeeds. If any of these return 0 (failure), then a
slide can be cut short but a jump will fail completely.
3. If any obstacles were encountered via Enter() or Cross() failing, then
src.Bump(obstacle) will be called for each of them.
4. If movement did not fail completely, then loc and step\_x/y, will be
changed, and the following calls will be made: oldloc.Exited() for any turfs,
areas, or other containers vacated; neighbor.Uncrossed() for any movable
atoms no longer overlapping; newloc.Entered() for any turfs, areas, or other
containers being entered for the first time; and neighbor.Crossed() for any
movable atoms now overlapping the object.

movable atoms now overlapping the object.




 A movement is considered a slide if src is moving from one turf to
another on the same z level, and the total pixel distance is less than either
src.step\_size or a full tile size (whichever is largest). Any other movement
is a jump. Movement to the same turf with no step\_x/y change is also
considered a jump.
