 The /atom/movable object type is the ancestor of all mappable objects that
are capable of motion. The types /obj and /mob are derived from
/atom/movable. You should not create instances of /atom/movable but should
use /obj and /mob for actual objects. This object definition exists solely
to define variables and procedures related to motion.
