 A "path" in DM is a constant value that identifies a particular definition
in the code tree (i.e. an object, procedure, or variable definition). An
example of this is the default mob type for new players
 `/mob` 
 .



`/mob`

 Paths are used in two contexts. One is to "get to" a particular point in
the code tree in order to modify the definition. The other is to reference a
particular definition made elsewhere in the code tree. The syntax of a path
is similar in both cases.




 When you are making a definition, you simply put the path at the beginning
of a line like this:




 obj/clothes/gloves


 That automatically creates that path in the code tree if it does not
already exist. When starting at the beginning of the line (no indentation)
there is no need to begin the path with '/', but that is perfectly acceptable.




 When making definitions, DM equates the path separator '/' with
indentation, so the above example is really just a more compact way of
writing:




 obj
 clothing
 gloves


 One generally uses indentation when you have several things to define with
a common parent path:




 obj
 clothing
 gloves
 sandals


 An important element of DM is that you can get to the same path in the
code tree from multiple places in the source code. For example, given the
above definition of
 `gloves` 
 and
 `sandals` 
 , you could
modify a property of one of them from somewhere else using any path syntax you
like:



`gloves`
`sandals`

 obj/clothing/sandals
 name = "Winged Sandals"


 While that was not a useful thing to do in this case, it can be a very
powerful tool when organizing source code in large projects. Also note that
the use of "/" can save your source code from getting too deeply indented,
which may sound mundane, but which is quite important!




 The above examples used paths to make definitions. The other time when you
use paths is when you need to refer to a particular definition. Creation of
an object is one example:




 mob/Login()
 if(length(contents) == 0) //poor fellow has nothing
 //create sandals in his contents list
 new /obj/clothing/sandals (src)
 return ..()


 Another common use of paths is to declare the data type of a variable. In
DM, variable types do not affect what type of data the variable may
containâ€”variables that you define may contain any type of value.
Instead, the variable type affects what properties of the data you can attempt
to access.




 The following example defines variables for clothing that is occupying
various positions on the body.




 mob
 var/clothing
 feet
 hands
 torso


 Since there were several variables of the same type, they were grouped
under
 `var/clothing` 
 . It can be done any number of ways, depending
on the situation. The same path syntax applies to variable definitions as
it does to anything else. This example produces the same effect:



`var/clothing`

 mob/var/clothing/feet
mob/var
 clothing
 hands
 torso

### 
 Provisos



 Just do not make a mistake like the following:




 mob/var
 /clothing/feet


 Beginning a path with '/' effectively ignores whatever indentation may
precede it. That is why it is called an
 *absolute* 
 path. The above
example would therefore be the same as the following, which is not what you
want:



*absolute*

 mob/var //empty variable definition
clothing/feet //definition of object type /clothing/feet


 On a related note, parameter definitions in procedures should not begin
with a "/".




 mob/Move(atom/Dest) //correct
 src << "Moving to [Dest.x],[Dest.y]."
 return ..()

mob/Move(var/atom/Dest) //ok
mob/Move(/atom/Dest) //WRONG


 Essentially, "var/" is prepended to each entry in the parameter list.
