 Equivalence is a looser version of equality:



* Two lists are equivalent if their contents are the same. (This is a
shallow comparison, so it doesn't check if the Nth items are also
equivalent, only equal.)
* Two

 datums are equivalent if their values
are the same.
* Datums A and B are equivalent if A

 the ~= operator with a proc that returns true for B.
