**Format:** 


 A &= B
 


**Format:** 

**Format:**

 A &= B


 Set A equal to A & B. It is shorthand for A = A & B.




 This is commonly used to turn off certain bitfields in a word.



### 
 Example:



 usr.sight &= ~BLIND // turn off the blind bit


 If A and B are lists, items in A that are not in B are removed.




 If A is an /icon or /matrix datum, the datum will be changed rather than
creating a new one and re-assigning it to A.
