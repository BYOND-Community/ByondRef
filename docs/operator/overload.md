 DM allows you to overload most of the operators it uses when working with
datums and other objects. This means that A + B can call a proc defined under
A instead, with B as an argument, and the return value of that proc would be
the result.




 The proc name for an overloaded operator is "operator" followed
immediately by the operator itself, such as
 `operator*` 
 to override
the multiplication operator.
 
 A \* B
 
 will call
 
 A.operator\*(B)
 
 if the proc is
available.



`operator*`

 A \* B


 A.operator\*(B)

### 
 Example:



 complex // complex number a+bi
 var/a as num
 var/b as num

 New(\_a,\_b)
 a = \_a
 b = \_b

 proc/operator+(complex/C)
 if(istype(C)) return new/complex(a+C.a, b+C.b)
 if(isnum(C)) return new/complex(a+C, b)
 return src

 proc/operator+=(complex/C)
 if(istype(C))
 a += C.a
 b += C.b
 else if(isnum(C)) a += C

 Some operators cannot be overloaded. The
 
 =
 
 operator for direct
assignment is one. The
 
 !
 
 operator is another. The
 
 ==
 
 and
 
 !=
 
 operators measure equality and can't be overloaded, but
 
 ~=
 
 and
 
 ~!
 
 for equivalence can be. It would also be meaningless to
override the ternary
 
 ? :
 
 operator pair, and the
 
 .
 
 and
 
 :
 
 family of operators for accessing vars and procs.




 =


 !


 ==


 !=


 ~=


 ~!


 ? :


 .


 :


 Comparison operators come in opposing pairs:
 
 ~=
 
 vs.
 
 ~!
 
 ,
 
 <
 
 vs.
 
 >=
 
 ,
 
 >
 
 vs.
 
 <=
 
 . You only
need to override one operator from each pair; DM is smart enough to know that
 `!(A ~= B)` 
 is the same as
 `A ~! B` 
 .




 ~=


 ~!


 <


 >=


 >


 <=

`!(A ~= B)`
`A ~! B`

 By the same logic, you don't have to define the assign-with-side-effect
operators like
 
 +=
 
 if you don't want to. For instance if you override
 
 +
 
 but not
 
 +=
 
 , then
 
 A += B
 
 will be handled internally as
 
 A = A + B
 
 , which means the value
of
 
 A
 
 after the statement may be a different datum than
 
 A
 
 was before. The value
of
 
 A
 
 can also change if you
 *do* 
 overload
 
 +=
 
 but the proc returns a value
other than null; its return value will be the new
 
 A
 
 .




 +=


 +


 +=


 A += B


 A = A + B


 A


 A


 A

*do*

 +=


 A


 If an overloaded proc is not available for an operator you try to use on
a datum, a runtime error may result.




 The output and input operators are given special treatment. If no overload
is defined for the current left-hand-side value, the overload proc is looked
up under
 `world` 
 instead. The world overload proc is also a
fallback if
 
 ..()
 
 is called, and after that
 
 ..()
 
 does the
default behavior. These procs are always called with multiple arguments, to
distinguish them from bitwise shift operators. The output version gets a
third argument when the result
 
 output()
 
 is sent, since that can
include a window reference.



`world`

 ..()


 ..()


 output()

### 
 Example:



 // Send an effect to a player or list of players
proc/DoEffect(target, effect/E)
 if(istype(target, /list))
 for(var/i in target) DoEffect(i, E)
 return
 if(target == world || target == world.contents)
 for(var/client/C) DoEffect(C, E)
 if(istype(target, /client))
 DoEffect(target:mob)
 if(istype(target, /mob))
 if(target:client)
 ... // do something here to show the effect

world/proc/operator<<(out, target)
 if(istype(target,/savefile)) return ..() // always save normally
 if(istype(out, /effect)) DoEffect(target, out)
 else ..()


 The list access operators are a special case as well, because reading
to a list and writing to it are different things, so there are two procs
for the purpose. The
 
 []
 
 overload is for reading, and
 
 []=
 
 is for writing.




 []


 []=


 There is also now an overload for converting a datum to text. By having
 
 operator""
 
 return a text string, that text will automatically
appear anywhere you embed the datum in a string, use
 
 json\_encode()
 
 on the datum, or many other situations. It won't work for atoms being sent
directly to output (e.g.,
 
 world << obj
 
 ) or other skin
controls because the client has special handling for these situations and
the client isn't given any info about the overloaded text. Likewise, the
overloaded text won't appear for objects in an
 
 input()
 
 prompt
list, which is also handled mainly on the client. Despite these limitations,
the text overload offers greater flexibility.




 operator""


 json\_encode()


 world << obj


 input()
