**Returns:** 


 If A is a number, returns A minus B.
 
 If A is a list, a new list is returned with B removed from the contents
 of A. If B is a list as well, each of its contents are removed rather
 than the list itself.
 
 If A is an icon, returns a new icon with B (a color or another icon)
 subtracted. Areas that are transparent in either icon are transparent in
 both. This works with the /icon datum as well.
 
 If A and B are both /matrix datums, returns a new matrix with their
 components subtracted.
