**Format:**

 A | B



**Returns:** 


 The binary "or" of A and B.
 


**Returns:** 

**Returns:**

 The binary "or" of A and B.


 A and B must be between 0 and 2\*\*24 - 1, giving an effective
width of 24 bits.




 If A and B are lists, the result is a list containing items that are in
either list. list(1,2) | list(2,3) is equivalent to list(1,2,3). The items
from A come first in the result, followed by any extra items from B.




 If A is an icon or /icon datum, it is blended with B which can be either
a color or another icon. Unlike the + or & operation, the result is
transparent only in places where both icons were transparent.
