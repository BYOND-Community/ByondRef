**Format:** 


 A + B
 


**Format:** 

**Format:**

 A + B



**Returns:** 


 If A is a number, returns the sum of A and B.
 
 If A is null, returns B.
 
 If A is a list, a new list is returned with B appended to the contents
 of A. If B is a list as well, its contents are appended rather than
 the list itself.
 
 If A is a text string, returns a new string with A and B concatenated.
 
 If A is an icon, returns a new icon with B (a color or another icon)
 added. Areas that are transparent in either icon are transparent in
 both; for more opacity use | (OR) instead. This works with the /icon
 datum as well.
 
 If A and B are both /matrix datums, returns a new matrix with their
 components added together.
