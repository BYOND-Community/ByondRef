 The dot operator may be used as a short-cut when specifying a path in the
DM code tree. Instead of specifying the full path, you can start a path with
a dot and the compiler will search up in the code tree for the following node.
This is known as a relative path with an "upward" search.




 Here are the beginnings of a text MUD that allows you to walk around
between rooms using the arrow keys. The links between rooms are created in
this example by referencing the object type of the destination room. Since
there could potentially be a lot of rooms, they are grouped into sub-classes,
and to avoid lengthy type paths such as /area/Village/Square, they are
referenced using a relative path from the point of reference.



### 
 Example:



 area
 var/area
 north\_exit
 south\_exit
 east\_exit
 west\_exit

 Entered(O)
 O << name
 return ..()

 Castle
 Main\_Gate
 north\_exit = .Castle\_Entryway
 south\_exit = .Moat\_Bridge
 Castle\_Entryway
 south\_exit = .Main\_Gate
 Moat\_Bridge
 north\_exit = .Main\_Gate
 south\_exit = .Village/Guard\_Post
 Village
 Guard\_Post
 north\_exit = .Castle/Moat\_Bridge
 south\_exit = .Square
 Square
 north\_exit = .Guard\_Post

//handle movement
client/Move(Dest,Dir)
 var/area/room = usr.loc
 if(istype(room)) //in a room
 switch(Dir)
 if(NORTH) Dest = room.north\_exit
 if(SOUTH) Dest = room.south\_exit
 if(EAST) Dest = room.east\_exit
 if(WEST) Dest = room.west\_exit
 return ..()

//set the starting position for new logins
mob/Login()
 if(!loc) Move(locate(/area/Castle/Main\_Gate))
 return ..()
