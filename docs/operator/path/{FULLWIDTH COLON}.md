 The colon operator may be used as a short-cut when specifying a path in the
DM code tree. Instead of specifying the full path, you can insert a colon and
the compiler will search down in the tree with the node you specify. This is
known as a "downward" search. You should only use it when the target node is
unique.




 The following example demonstrates the principle but it obviously doesn't
save much typing!



### 
 Example:



 world
 mob = :player //short-cut to /mob/player

mob/player
 Login()
 src << "Welcome, [name]."
