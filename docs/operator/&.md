**Returns:**

 The binary "and" of A and B.


 A and B must be between 0 and 2\*\*24 - 1, giving an effective
width of 24 bits.




 If A and B are lists, the result is a list that contains only items that
were in both lists, in the order of list A.




 If A is an icon or /icon datum, it is blended with B which can be either
a color or another icon. This is identical to the + operator. Transparent
areas in either icon will be transparent in the result.
