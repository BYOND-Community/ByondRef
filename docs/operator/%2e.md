 This is used to access the procs and vars of a prototyped object. The
variable need not actually contain a value with the specified type, but must
at least be a type with the specified variable or a runtime error will
occur, causing the proc to crash.



### 
 Example:



 var/mob/M = new
M.name = "futz" // assign 'name' mob var
M.Move(0) // call 'Move()' mob proc


 This is the same as the
 
 :
 
 operator, except that the compiler
checks to see if the var type has this property, and throws a compiler error
if not. It is good practice to use the
 
 .
 
 operator whenever possible,
so more potential problems can be caught during compilation.

 If
 
 .
 
 follows a proc call, a list lookup, or a complex expression
where the type can't be known, it will act like
 
 :
 
 instead.
