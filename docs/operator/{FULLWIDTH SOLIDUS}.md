**Format:**

 A / B



**Returns:** 


 A divided by B.
 


**Returns:** 

**Returns:**

 A divided by B.


 If A is an icon, the result is a new icon whose color values (except alpha)
are divided by B, which must be a number. This works with the /icon datum as
well.




 If A is a /matrix datum, the result is a new matrix. B can be a number
(which scales the whole matrix) or another matrix. Dividing by matrix B is the
same as multiplyng by its inverse. That is, A / B is identical to A \* ~B.
