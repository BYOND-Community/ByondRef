 Writes Val to a buffer. If Path is not specified, the current buffer
will be used. Otherwise, the buffer at the specified path will be written
to. Whenever the current directory is set, writing starts at the beginning
of that buffer (replacing any previous contents). For this reason, when the
Path parameter is given, the specified buffer is always overwritten.




 If Val is an object, a separate directory will be created for the object
and the object's Write proc will be called. In addition to data that may be
written by the Write() proc, the type of the object is stored in a buffer
called "type". In the case of turfs, the location of the turf is also
recorded so that it can be recreated at the same position. All other objects
must be repositioned after the object is recreated (like in the object's
Read() proc).




 Single operations that write multiple values (such as saving an object) are
handled somewhat specially to avoid two references to the same object creating
duplicate entries in the savefile. After the object being referenced is
written once, successive references to the same object will be saved simply as
references rather than as full objects. If this was not done, two references
to the same object would be read back in as two separate objects. This also
avoids infinite loops that would result when objects contain references back
to themselves.
