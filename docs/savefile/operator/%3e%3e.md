 Reads a value from a buffer into a variable. If Path is not specified, the
current buffer will be used. Otherwise, the buffer at the specified path will
be accessed. Whenever the current directory is set, reading starts at the
beginning of that buffer (replacing any previous contents). For this reason,
when the Path parameter is given, the first value in the specified buffer is
always read. If there is no data in the buffer or the end of the buffer has
been reached, null is returned.




 If the value read is a previously written object, its own directory will be
opened and the object's Read proc will be called to load any data that was
written in the object's Write proc.




 If the value read is a savefile (ie a savefile inside of a savefile), it is
treated a little differently. Instead of returning a savefile object, it
returns data cached in the world's rsc file. This is to give you control over
what file this data is copied into before it is opened as a savefile. If you
want to just open it up in a temporary file, do something like this:




 obj
 var
 savefile/myfile
 Read()
 . = ..() //do the normal stuff
 if(myfile) //load data into a temporary file and create savefile object
 myfile = new/savefile(myfile)
