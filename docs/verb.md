 Verbs may be attached to mobs, objs, turfs, and areas. Players can then
use them as commands if they have access to the source.




 Verbs are fundamentally the same "type" as procs, so their vars are the
same.



### 
 Example:



 mob/verb/poof()
 world << "POOF!"


 Whenever a player in the world types the command "poof", this verb will
be invoked.




 In addition to the normal access control (see the verb src setting) verbs
can be dynamically added and removed from objects. One way to do this is to
use new() with the following syntax:




 new verb\_path(Destination,Name,Desc)


 The Destination specifies the object to receive the verb. Name and Desc
optionally specify a new name and description for the verb.



### 
 Example:



 mob/DM/verb/kill(mob/M)
 del(M)

mob/DM/verb/give\_kill\_verb(mob/M)
 new/mob/DM/verb/kill(M)


 This example defines two verbs (accessible to mobs of type /mob/DM). One
verb kills other mobs. The other adds the kill verb to another mob (giving
the second mob the ability to kill).




 In some situations, the ability to dynamically change an object's verb
list is quite useful, but most of the time it is far more convenient to do
the same thing by manipulating objects rather than verbs directly. For
example, the previous example can be handled by having an object with the
kill verb attached it it. Then players have greater versatility in
manipulating the verb by simply moving the object around.



### 
 Example:



 obj/scroll/kill/verb/kill(mob/M)
 set src = usr.contents //implicit src
 del(M)


 The use of an implicit verb source in this example gives the user access
to the kill verb without having to specify the source scroll as long as the
scroll exists in the user's inventory. In other words, the player types
"kill rat" rather than "kill kill rat".
