 Numbers
---------



 In DM, all numbers are stored in floating point format. Specifically,
single-precision (32-bit) floating point. This is important to know if you
think you will be working with large numbers or decimal values a lot, because
the accuracy of the numbers is limited.




 32-bit floating point numbers can represent integers from -16777216
to 16777216 (2
 24 
 ). Non-integer values can get about as small as
2
 -126 
 and as large as 2
 127 
 .

 Floating point numbers do not handle most decimal values precisely. For
instance, 0.1 is not exactly 0.1, because floating point numbers are stored
in a binary format and in binary, 1/10 is a fraction that repeats
foreverâ€”the same way 1/3 repeats as 0.33333... in decimal numbers. It
ends up being rounded off, either a little higher or a littler lower than
its true value. This means that the following loop won't work like you might
expect:



### 
 Example:



 for(i = 0, i < 100, i += 0.1)
 world << i


 You might expect that code to loop exactly 1000 times, with
 
 i
 
 going from 0 up to 99.9 before stopping. The truth is more complicated,
because 0.1 stored in floating point is actually greater than the exact value
of 0.1. Other values might be more or less than their exact numbers, and as
you add these numbers together repeatedly you'll introduce more and more
rounding error.




 i


 Even more insidious, if you add 0.1 a bunch of times starting from 0, and
then subtract it out again the same number of times, the result you get may
not be 0. This is counterintuitive, because you might expect rounding errors
to reverse themselves in the same order they crept in. Unfortunately it
doesn't work that way.




 You can correct for rounding error somewhat by using the
 [round
 
 proc](#/proc/round) 
 to adjust the loop var each time,
although for performance reasons it might be preferable to find another
alternative.



[round
 
 proc](#/proc/round)

 round


 for(i = 0, i < 100, i = round(i + 0.1, 0.1))
 world << i


 Only fractions whose denominators are powers of 2 are immune to this
rounding error, so 0.5 is in fact stored as an exact value.




 Another place floating point may lose accuracy is when you try to add
numbers of very different sizes. For instance as stated above, the upper
limit for accurate integers is 16777216. If you try to use a number such
as 100 million it will only be approximate, so adding 1 to that number
won't actually change it because the 1 is so much smaller, it will be
gobbled up by rounding error.




 Also for the same reasons stated above, division will cost you
accuracy. Again you can divide by powers of 2 easily enough, and you can
divide an integer by any of its factors (like dividing 9 by 3) without a
problem, but a fraction like 1/3 will repeat forever so it gets rounded
to as much precision as floating point can manage.




 In decimal, floating point numbers have at least six decimal digits of
precision. Since they're actually stored in binary, their true precision
is exactly 24 bits.
