 BYOND was originally written to handle 8-bit ("ANSI") characters only.
However as time has marched on, Unicode has become ubiquitous for supporting
multiple languages, special characters, and emojis. To adapt to this, BYOND
now supports Unicode.




 When ANSI was king, every character was exactly one byte in width, because
the only valid characters were between 1 and 255. (And technically, BYOND
reserved 255 for its own use.) Now, BYOND uses an encoding called UTF-8 to
store characters that can't fit in one byte.




 UTF-8 breaks up characters with codes of 128 or higher into multiple
bytes, like so:





| 
 Character code
  | 
 Size in bytes
  |
| --- | --- |
| 
 0 - 0x7F
  | 
 1
  |
| 
 0x80 - 0x7FF
  | 
 2
  |
| 
 0x800 - 0xFFFF
  | 
 3
  |
| 
 0x10000 - 0x10FFFF
  | 
 4

### 
 Text handling



 Importantly, BYOND's text procs are based on the byte position, not the
character position which may be lower. In other words,
 
 length("abcdéfg")
 
 is greater than 7; it's 8, because
 
 é
 
 takes up 2 bytes in UTF-8. That also means
 
 f
 
 is at
position 7, not position 6.




 length("abcdéfg")


 é


 f


 Why do the text procs work with byte position instead of character
position? Because ultimately, it's faster. Going by character position would
require counting every byte in a string (at least when it uses UTF-8) until
the right character position was found. This would be detrimental to
performance in most cases.




 For the most part, this distinction should be fairly invisible to you.
Most code isn't going to encounter problems, but if you do a lot of text
processing you should be aware of it.




 In particular,
 [text2ascii()](#/proc/text2ascii) 
 returns the Unicode value at a specific position, which may cover several
bytes. If you loop through a string calling this proc for each character,
you'll have to make adjustments for cases when multiple bytes have been
read.



[text2ascii()](#/proc/text2ascii)

 The read-only
 
 []
 
 index operator also uses byte positions.

 If you read a byte or cut text at an inappropriate point, any broken
characters resulting from the cut will be turned into the Unicode
replacement character � which is 0xFFFD.

 \_char
 
 procs



 \_char


 Most of the text handling procs have slower
 
 \_char
 
 versions (e.g.,
 
 copytext\_char
 
 ) that use character positions instead of byte
positions.




 \_char


 copytext\_char


 These should be used sparingly if at all; whenever it's possible to use
byte positions, you should. When you do use a
 
 \_char
 
 version of a
proc, prefer using
 
 -offset
 
 instead of
 
 length\_char(text)-offset
 
 for positions near the end of the string.
Most text procs allow negative position values that count backwards from the
end, and counting a small number of characters backward is faster than
counting a lot of characters going forward.

 Code written in ANSI will be up-converted to UTF-8 by Dream Maker, based on
your current locale when the code is loaded.
