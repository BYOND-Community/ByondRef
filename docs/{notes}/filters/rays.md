 Format:
 

 filter(type="rays", ...)
 


 Format:


 filter(type="rays", ...)



 Args:
 

 x: Horiztonal position of ray center, relative to image center (defaults to 0)
 

 y: Vertical position of ray center, relative to image center (defaults to 0)
 

 size: Maximum length of rays (defaults to 1/2 tile width)
 

 color: Ray color (defaults to white)
 

 offset: "Time" offset of rays (defaults to 0, repeats after 1000)
 

 density: Higher values mean more, narrower rays (defaults to 10, must be whole number)
 

 threshold: Low-end cutoff for ray strength (defaults to 0.5, can be 0 to 1)
 

 factor: How much ray strength is related to ray length (defaults to 0, can be 0 to 1)
 

 flags: Defaults to
 
 FILTER\_OVERLAY | FILTER\_UNDERLAY
 
 (see below)

 FILTER\_OVERLAY | FILTER\_UNDERLAY


 Draws random rays that radiate outward from a center point. (That point may
be outside of the image.) As they move outward, their alpha value diminishes
linearly. These are meant to be animated. The
 
 offset
 
 value determines
the "time", where every jump of +1 can be a very different set of rays, and
every 1000 units this filter will repeat.




 offset


 The
 
 threshold
 
 value can be thought of as a way of culling
lower-strength rays. Ray strength is anywhere from 0 to 1 at any given angle,
but values below
 
 threshold
 
 may as well be 0. Values above that are
re-scaled into a range of 0 to 1.

 The
 
 factor
 
 parameter allows you to tie the ray's length to its
strength. At 0, the length of every ray is the same. At 1, the length ranges
from 0 to
 
 size
 
 . Generally speaking, the higher
 
 factor
 
 is,
the more the rays will appear to move outward as they strengthen and inward
as they weaken.

 Ray
 
 color
 
 can be provided as a matrix. Only the diagonal values of the
color matrix will be used, but using a matrix will allow you to set values
outside of the normal color range.

 flags
 
 can have the following values:




 flags



 0
 

 The rays are drawn alone, erasing the existing image (useful for some effects).
 

 FILTER\_OVERLAY
 

 The rays are overlaid on top of the existing image.
 

 FILTER\_UNDERLAY
 

 The rays are drawn underneath the existing image.
 

 FILTER\_OVERLAY | FILTER\_UNDERLAY
 

 Default. For plane masters, this will use the
 
 FILTER\_OVERLAY
 
 behavior and draw the rays over the plane, and for all other images it will default to
 
 FILTER\_UNDERLAY
 
 to draw the rays beneath them.
