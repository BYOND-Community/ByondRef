 Args:
 

 x: Horizontal center of effect, in pixels, relative to image center
 

 y: Vertical center of effect, in pixels, relative to image center
 

 size: Amount of blur per pixel of distance (defaults to 0.01)

 Blurs the image by a certain amount outward from the center, as if the
image is zooming in or out. As the distance from the center increases, the
amount of blurring increases, and near the center the blur is hardly visible
at all. The
 
 size
 
 value is smaller by default for this filter than it
is for other filters, since it's typically used with an entire plane where the
distance from the center can easily be several hundred pixels.

 Typically this blur is used with an entire plane.




 Note: Large blurs will look worse toward the edges due to limited sampling.
Loss of accuracy will begin when
 
 size
 
 Ã— distance is greather
than 6. You can increase accuracy by breaking up large sizes into multiple
filter passes. The blur used is Gaussian, so combining blur sizes A and B will
give a total size of sqrt(A
 2 
 +B
 2 
 ).
