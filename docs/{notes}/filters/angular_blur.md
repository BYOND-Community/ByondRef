 Blurs the image by a certain amount in a circular formation, as if the
image is spinning. The size of the blur can roughly be thought of in "degrees"
worth of blur. As the distance from the center increases, the blur becomes
more noticeable since the same amount of angular motion has to travel farther
along a circle.




 Typically this blur is used with an entire plane, but it could be used to
give a sense of motion blur to a spinning object.




 Note: Large blurs will look worse toward the edges due to limited sampling.
Loss of accuracy will appear where
 
 size
 
 Ã— distance is greater
than about 300. You can increase accuracy by breaking up large sizes into
multiple filter passes with differing sizes. The blur used is Gaussian, so
combining blur sizes A and B will give a total size of
sqrt(A
 2 
 +B
 2 
 ).
