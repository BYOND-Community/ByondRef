 stddef.dm file
----------------



 This is a special file that's included in all projects when you compile.
It contains various constants, definitions of some built-in datums, and so on.




 You can see the contents of this file by creating a new file in Dream
Maker called
 
 stddef.dm
 
 . It will automatically be filled with the
standard definitions.

 The contents of
 
 stddef.dm
 
 may change with new BYOND versions.
However an eye is always kept on backwards-compatibility.
