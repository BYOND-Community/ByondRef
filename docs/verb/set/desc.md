 Description: A text string containing the help text.


 The desc attribute sets the descriptive help string for the verb. The
player may access this by hitting the 'F1' key after entering the command.
This will normally produce a list of each argument by type followed by the
desc text. If you wish to override the syntax description, put your
modified version inside parentheses at the beginning of the desc text.



### 
 Example:



 mob/verb/tell(mob/M,T as text)
 set desc = "(target,message) Talk privately to someone."
 M << "[usr] tells you, '[T]"


 This will produce the help text:




 usage: tell target message (Talk privately to someone.)


 If the syntax description had not been supplied, it would have produced:




 usage: tell mob "text" (Talk privately to someone.)
