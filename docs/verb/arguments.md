 The parameters to a verb are referred to as arguments. For verbs, the
input type and possible value list may also be specified.




 The possible input types are:




```
text          // a quoted text string
password      // un-echoed text (for use with input() only)
message       // multi-line text
command_text  // raw command text from the rest of the input line
num           // a number
icon          // an icon file from the user's computer
sound         // a sound file from the user's computer
file          // any type of file from the user's computer
key           // a key from the user's BYOND key file
color         // a color (see [rgb proc](#/proc/rgb))
null          // indicates that the argument is optional

mob
obj
turf
area
anything

```

[rgb proc](#/proc/rgb)

 These can be combined with the '|' operator. The first group are called
 *constant* 
 input types because they turn on various types of literal
values that the user can type in (like a number or a text string). The
second group work in conjunction with a list of objects or values. They are
called input type
 *filters* 
 because they may be used to filter out
certain types of values from the list. For example a mob or an obj within
sight would be specified as follows:



*constant*
*filters*

 myverb(M as mob|obj in view()) {...}


 A default value may be specified which takes effect in the case of null
arguments. For example:




 myverb(M=usr as null|mob|obj in view()) {...}


 In this example, the input type
 `null` 
 did not have to be used
explicitly, because assigning a default value (in this case
 `usr` 
 ) turns it on by default.



`null`
`usr`

 The
 `anything` 
 input type can be used to combine values in a
list with other constant input types. Here, this is done with the
 `null` 
 input type:



`anything`
`null`

 set\_aggression(a="on" as null|anything in list("on","off"))


 For input types containing mob, obj, turf, or area, the possible value
list defaults to view().




 If no input type is specified, the variable type will be used to
determine whether it is a mob, obj, turf, or area.



### 
 Example:



 mob/verb/tell(mob/M,msg as text)
 M << "[usr] tells you, /"[msg]/""


 This example defines a verb with two arguments: a target mob, and some
text.
