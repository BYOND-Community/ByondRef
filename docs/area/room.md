 rooms
-------



 Areas that are not located on the map are referred to as
 *rooms* 
 .
When a player enters one, the map goes away and you have something like a text
MUD. By default, there would be no way for players to move from one room to
another, so you have to handle movement yourself.



*rooms*

 You can check the variable
 [area.x](#/atom/var/x) 
 to see if a
given area is on the map or not.



[area.x](#/atom/var/x)

 The following example puts players in a room when they log in and provides
a single exit.



### 
 Example:



 mob/Login()
 if(!loc) Move(locate(/area/birthing\_hut))
 return ..()

area/birthing\_hut
 Entered(O)
 O << "Waaaaah! You land in a pile of straw."
 return ..()
 verb/exit()
 if(Move(locate(1,1,1))) //jump to the map or whatever
 usr << "You crawl into the open air..."
 else
 usr << "The hut door is blocked. You cannot get out."
